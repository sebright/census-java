/**
 * A distribution contains summary statistics for a population of values and, optionally, a
 * histogram representing the distribution of those values across a specified set of histogram
 * buckets.
 *
 * <p>The bucket boundaries for that histogram are described by {@link BucketBoundaries}, which
 * defines {@code BucketBoundaries.getBoundaries().size() + 1 (= N)} buckets.
 * The boundaries for bucket index i are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>[-infinity, bounds[i]) for i == 0
 *   <li>[bounds[i-1], bounds[i]) for 0 &lt; i &lt; N-1
 *   <li>[bounds[i-1], +infinity) for i == N-1
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>i.e. an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or more finite buckets (1 through N - 2, and an
 * overflow bucket (N - 1), with inclusive lower bounds and exclusive upper bounds.
 *
 * <p>Note: If N = 1, there are no finite buckets and the single bucket is both the overflow and
 * underflow bucket.
 * TODO(songya): needs to determine whether N = 1 is valid. (Currently we don't allow N = 1.)
 *
 * <p>Although not forbidden, it is generally a bad idea to include non-finite values (infinities or
 * NaNs) in the population of values, as this will render the {@code mean} meaningless.
